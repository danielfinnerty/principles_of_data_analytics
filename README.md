# Principles of Data Analytics

by Daniel Finnerty

## Introduction

This project is to both develop an understanding of the 'why' and 'how' of data analytics, and put it into practice through analysis of a data set. This is achieved with the use of the listed technolgies.

- Python
- Git
- Github
- Codespaces
- Jupyter
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

The process and method, starting at loading the dataset, right through to analysis of the set can be found in tasks.ipynb.

The dataset in question is the commonly used Fisher iris dataset. Given it's simplicity and versatility, it is a popular choice for development and demonstration of new found capabilities in analysing and presenting information.

## Running the Notebook locally
The notebook can be ran locally however, prior to do this the repository will need to be cloned to your local machine through the following steps:

### Using cmder

1. Download and install full version of cmder from:  
https://cmder.app/ 

2. In cmder, clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/danielfinnerty/principles_of_data_analytics.git
```

3. On your local machine, set new repository as directory

4. Configure git pull rebase

```
git config pull.rebase false
```

5. Open repository

```
python -m notebook
```
